Minecraft Mechanics Deep Dive for Fluid AI (Advanced)
This document provides a deeper, more technical look into Minecraft's core systems. The goal is to offer code-level insights to help you build a more fluid, intelligent, and human-like AI for "Chipper Chopper".

1. Player Movement & Physics Engine
To achieve truly natural movement, your AI needs to replicate the nuances of the player physics engine, which is governed by a series of velocity calculations performed every tick.

Key Concepts & Code Logic:
Ticking (20 TPS): All movement is a result of velocity changes applied over discrete time steps (ticks). PlayerEntity.tick() is the entry point for most of these updates.

Velocity, Acceleration, and Friction: Movement is not binary. It's a continuous application of forces.

On Ground: When a player presses a movement key, a force is applied, increasing their velocity. The default acceleration is 0.1. This velocity is then multiplied by a ground friction factor (typically 0.91) each tick.

In Air: Air control is significantly less. The acceleration factor is much lower (around 0.02), making sharp turns impossible. Your AI should not attempt to change direction abruptly while airborne.

Sprinting: Increases the base movement speed by about 30% and adds a small burst of forward velocity when initiated.

Practical Tips & Pseudocode:
Smooth Rotations (Interpolation):

Concept: To avoid jerky head movements, calculate the required change in yaw and pitch and spread it across multiple ticks.

Pseudocode:

// In your AI's tick method
float targetYaw = calculateYawToTarget(targetPos);
float currentYaw = player.getYaw();
float yawDifference = targetYaw - currentYaw;

// Normalize the difference to handle wrapping around 360 degrees
while (yawDifference < -180.0F) yawDifference += 360.0F;
while (yawDifference >= 180.0F) yawDifference -= 360.0F;

// The 'turnSpeed' determines how fast the AI turns.
float turnSpeed = 15.0F; // Degrees per tick
float yawThisTick = Math.clamp(yawDifference, -turnSpeed, turnSpeed);

player.setYaw(currentYaw + yawThisTick);
// Repeat for pitch

Simulating Momentum:

Concept: Instead of just setting movement keys to true/false, manage a velocity vector for your AI. This allows for smoother starts and stops.

Pseudocode:

// AI has a desiredVelocity and a currentVelocity
if (isMovingToTarget) {
    desiredVelocity = 1.0; // Represents full forward speed
} else {
    desiredVelocity = 0.0;
}

// Lerp (linear interpolate) between current and desired velocity
currentVelocity = lerp(currentVelocity, desiredVelocity, 0.1); // 0.1 is the acceleration factor

// Apply friction
currentVelocity *= 0.91F;

// Only press the key if there's enough velocity
mc.options.forwardKey.setPressed(currentVelocity > 0.01);

2. Collision and A* Pathfinding
To navigate complex environments, your AI needs a more robust system than simple obstacle avoidance. Leveraging concepts from Minecraft's own entity pathfinding is key.

Key Concepts & Code Logic:
AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box): The player's collision is a rigid box (0.6W x 1.8H). All collision checks are based on this box intersecting with block bounding boxes. The world.getCollisions() method is fundamental for this.

"Stepping" Logic: This is not a jump. When a player moves into a block that is less than 0.6 blocks high, the game automatically moves the player's Y-position up to "step" onto it. You can check for this by analyzing potential collisions in the direction of movement.

Pathfinding Nodes: Minecraft mobs use a pathfinding system based on a grid of nodes. Each node represents a block space and has properties like its "walkability" cost.

Practical Tips & Pseudocode:
Implementing A* Pathfinding:

Concept: A* is an algorithm that finds the shortest path between two points by evaluating nodes based on their distance from the start (gCost) and their estimated distance to the end (hCost). The total cost is fCost = gCost + hCost.

Simplified A* Pseudocode:

// Data Structures
Set<Node> openSet; // Nodes to be evaluated
Set<Node> closedSet; // Nodes already evaluated
Map<Node, Node> cameFrom; // To reconstruct the path

// Algorithm
startNode.gCost = 0;
startNode.hCost = calculateHeuristic(startNode, endNode);
openSet.add(startNode);

while (!openSet.isEmpty()) {
    Node current = findNodeWithLowestFCost(openSet);
    if (current == endNode) {
        return reconstructPath(cameFrom, current);
    }

    openSet.remove(current);
    closedSet.add(current);

    for (Node neighbor : getWalkableNeighbors(current)) {
        if (closedSet.contains(neighbor)) continue;

        float tentativeGCost = current.gCost + calculateDistance(current, neighbor);
        if (tentativeGCost < neighbor.gCost || !openSet.contains(neighbor)) {
            cameFrom.put(neighbor, current);
            neighbor.gCost = tentativeGCost;
            neighbor.hCost = calculateHeuristic(neighbor, endNode);
            if (!openSet.contains(neighbor)) {
                openSet.add(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}
// No path found
return null;

Path Cost: When calculating the cost for a node, consider factors like: Is it water? Is it a climbable vine? Does it require a jump? This makes the AI smarter about its route choices.

Smarter Leaf Management:

When the A* path is blocked by leaves, add those leaf blocks to a temporary "to break" queue. The AI can then switch to a "breaking" state, clear the path, and then resume its "moving" state.

3. Block Interaction and Server-Side Logic
All block breaking is ultimately validated by the server. Your client-side simulation must accurately predict the server's response.

Key Concepts & Code Logic:
Block Breaking Speed: This is calculated based on several factors:

Tool Effectiveness: Is the tool (e.g., axe) the correct one for the block (e.g., wood)?

Tool Material: Netherite is faster than iron.

Efficiency Enchantment: Adds a significant speed bonus.

Haste/Mining Fatigue Status Effects: These directly multiply the breaking speed.

Player State: Is the player on the ground? In the water? These also apply penalties.

The PlayerEntity.getBlockBreakingSpeed(BlockState) method is your friend here. It encapsulates all of this complex logic.

Raycasting (world.raycast): This is the definitive way to check for line of sight. It takes a start vector (player's eyes), an end vector (center of the target block), and returns the first block it hits. If the returned block is not your target block, then your view is obstructed.

Practical Tips:
Predictive Mining Time:

Before starting to mine, call player.getBlockBreakingSpeed() for the target block.

Use this value to calculate how many ticks it will take to break the block.

Your AI should "hold" the attack for exactly that duration. This prevents unnecessary waiting and makes the AI more efficient.

Advanced Tree Analysis:

Flood Fill Algorithm: When a tree is found, use a flood-fill or similar recursive search algorithm starting from the base log. This will identify all connected log blocks that are part of the same tree.

This allows the AI to create a complete "chopping plan" for the entire tree, including branches, making it far more thorough than just pillar-chopping.

4. Mob AI Systems (Zombies, Skeletons)
To create a truly intelligent agent, we can borrow heavily from Minecraft's own mob AI. The system is a modular stack of "Goals" and "Controls" that work together to produce complex behavior.

Vision & Target Acquisition
This is how a mob decides what to care about. For your AI, the "target" is a tree.

Key Concepts & Code Logic:

Goal System: Mob AI is built on a priority queue of Goals. For example, a Zombie has goals like AttackGoal, WanderAroundGoal, and LookAtEntityGoal. The AI will always try to execute the highest-priority goal whose conditions (canStart()) are met.

TargetGoal: A special type of Goal for finding targets. NearestAttackableTargetGoal is a common implementation. It periodically scans a configurable area (GENERIC_FOLLOW_RANGE, typically ~35 blocks) for entities of a specific type.

Sensing / canSee(): This is the core of vision. It's more than a single raycast. The game checks for line-of-sight from the mob's eye position to several points on the target's bounding box. This prevents mobs from losing sight of you just because your foot is behind a block. Vision is also affected by light levels and the Invisibility effect.

LookControl: Once a target is acquired, this controller manages the mob's head rotation. It smoothly interpolates the head's yaw and pitch towards the target over several ticks, preventing instant, robotic head snaps.

Practical Tips for "Chipper Chopper":

Create a FindTreeGoal: Instead of looking for players, your AI's highest-priority "goal" would be to find a valid tree. You can adapt the logic from NearestAttackableTargetGoal to scan for log blocks instead of entities.

Implement "Tree Vision": To find the "best" tree, don't just find the closest one. Scan a wide area and check for line of sight to the base of each potential tree. Prioritize trees that are fully visible and unobstructed. This simulates the canSee() check.

Adopt LookControl Principles: Use the smooth rotation logic from Section 1 not just for moving, but for looking at the specific log block you intend to chop.

Navigation & Movement
This is how a mob moves from point A to point B once it has a target.

Key Concepts & Code Logic:

Navigation: The main pathfinding class (MobEntity.getNavigation()). When given a target position, it uses the A* Pathfinder to generate a Path object.

Path: A list of PathNodes that represents the route.

MoveControl: This is the key to fluid movement. It's a controller that takes the current Path and translates it into velocity commands for the mob. It's responsible for moving the mob forward towards the next node, strafing for minor adjustments, and slowing down as it approaches the destination.

JumpControl: A simple controller that checks if the mob should jump.

PathNodeType: The A* pathfinder assigns a "cost" to each block type. Water, lava, and open doors have different costs, influencing the generated path.

Practical Tips for "Chipper Chopper":

Follow the Path Fluidly: Once your A* algorithm generates a path, don't just have the AI walk directly to the final destination. Have it walk from node to node.

Simulate MoveControl:

Make the AI look towards the next node in the path, not the final tree.

As the player gets close to a node, smoothly update its rotation to look towards the next node after that. This makes the AI naturally curve around corners.

If a node is slightly to the left or right, use the strafeLeftKey or strafeRightKey for minor adjustments.

Contextual Jumping: If your A* path requires a jump (e.g., the next node is one block higher), use that information to trigger the jumpKey.

5. Advanced AI Concepts & Systems
To elevate the AI from a simple bot to a believable agent, we need to integrate more complex decision-making, environmental awareness, and performance optimizations.

Beyond State Machines: Behavior Trees
A simple state machine (IDLE -> MOVING -> CHOPPING) works, but it's brittle and hard to scale. A Behavior Tree is a more powerful, modular alternative used in modern game AI.

Concept: A tree of nodes that dictates behavior. It's evaluated from the root every tick.

Sequence Node: Executes its children in order. Fails if any child fails. (e.g., Move To Tree -> Chop Tree -> Collect Logs).

Selector Node: Executes children until one succeeds. A "fallback" mechanism. (e.g., Is Axe Equipped? OR Find and Equip Axe).

Task Node: An action, like MoveToPosition or SwingAxe.

Decorator Node: Modifies a child's behavior, like Inverter (succeeds if child fails) or Repeater.

Conceptual Behavior Tree for "Chipper Chopper":

ROOT (Selector)
|-- Is Inventory Full? (Sequence)
|   |-- Pathfind to Chest
|   |-- Deposit Logs
|-- Is Axe Broken? (Sequence)
|   |-- Find Best Axe in Inventory
|   |-- Equip Axe
|-- Has Target Tree? (Selector)
|   |-- Is At Target Tree? (Sequence)
|   |   |-- Is Tree Chopped? (Sequence)
|   |   |   |-- Collect Nearby Drops
|   |   |   |-- Replant Sapling
|   |   |   |-- Invalidate Target
|   |   |-- Chop Next Log
|   |-- Move To Target Tree
|-- Find New Target Tree (Task)
|-- Wander Randomly (Task)

Environmental & Inventory Intelligence
Hazard Detection: The A* pathfinder's cost function is the key. Before evaluating a node, check its surroundings.

if (world.getBlockState(nodePos.down()).isOf(Blocks.LAVA)) { node.cost = a_very_high_number; }

This prevents the AI from ever considering a path through lava, over a cliff, or into cactus.

Tool Management Logic:

On Task Start: Before chopping, iterate through the player's inventory (player.getInventory()).

Scan & Score: Find all ItemStack where item instanceof AxeItem. Assign a score based on material tier, Efficiency level (EnchantmentHelper.getLevel), and remaining durability (itemStack.getMaxDamage() - itemStack.getDamage()).

Equip Best: If the best-scoring axe isn't in the selected hotbar slot, simulate a key press or directly set player.getInventory().selectedSlot to equip it.

Inventory Management:

Check Fullness: Before moving to a new tree, check if the inventory is nearly full.

Identify "Junk": Define a list of disposable items (e.g., DIRT, COBBLESTONE, ROTTEN_FLESH). If the inventory is full, find the first stack of junk and simulate a drop key press (mc.options.dropKey).

Chest Logic: A more advanced feature would involve setting a "home" chest position. If the inventory is full, the AI's goal changes to pathfinding to the chest, depositing logs, and then returning to its task.

Performance & Tick Optimization
Running all these checks every tick is expensive. Staggering tasks is crucial.

Task Staggering: Use the player's age (tick counter) to distribute workload.

if (player.age % 80 == 0): Scan for new trees in a wide radius (every 4 seconds).

if (player.age % 5 == 0): Update the A* path if the target is far away.

This prevents expensive operations like area scanning and pathfinding from lagging the game.

Simulating Human Imperfection:

Pathing Deviations: When following a path, add a tiny, random offset to the target coordinates of each node. This will create slight, natural-looking curves in movement instead of perfectly straight lines.

Micro-Pauses: After felling a tree or equipping a new tool, introduce a small, random delay (e.g., wait_ticks = 5 + random.nextInt(10)), during which the AI does nothing. This simulates "thinking" time.

Target Re-evaluation: Even with a target, have the AI occasionally (e.g., 5% chance per second) re-scan its immediate area. If a much closer or easier tree appears (e.g., a player plants one nearby), it might "change its mind" and switch targets, which feels very human.
