# üß† AI Behaviors & Decision Making

## Overview
Chipper Chopper's AI uses a sophisticated state machine with intelligent decision making to create realistic, player-like tree harvesting behavior. This document explains how the AI thinks and acts.

## üéØ AI States

### üîç IDLE
**What it does**: Scans the environment for opportunities
- Searches for trees within 16-block radius
- Looks for dropped items to collect
- Prioritizes tree chopping over item collection
- Resets collection attempts to prevent getting stuck

### üö∂ MOVING_TO_TREE
**What it does**: Navigates toward a selected tree
- Uses physics-based movement with acceleration/deceleration
- Maintains line-of-sight to target while moving
- Switches to CLEARING_LEAVES if leaves block the path
- Gives up if tree is too far away (50+ blocks)

### ‚úÇÔ∏è CLEARING_LEAVES (NEW!)
**What it does**: Removes obstructing leaves before chopping
- **Raycast Detection**: Uses line-of-sight checks to find blocking leaves
- **Strategic Targeting**: Focuses on specific leaf blocks obstructing the view
- **Smart Repositioning**: Moves to better positions if current angle is blocked
- **All Leaf Types**: Recognizes all Minecraft leaf variants (Oak, Birch, Spruce, Jungle, Acacia, Dark Oak, Mangrove, Cherry, Pale Oak)

### ü™ì CHOPPING
**What it does**: Systematically harvests tree blocks
- **Bottom-Up Strategy**: Starts from tree base and works upward
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Checks for new leaf obstructions
- **Position Optimization**: Moves underneath trees for better angles
- **2x2 Tree Support**: Handles large trees (Dark Oak, Jungle) completely
- **Timeout Handling**: Finds alternative blocks if stuck (120 ticks = 6 seconds)

### üéØ REPOSITIONING
**What it does**: Moves to better positions when stuck
- **Under-Tree Positioning**: Finds spots underneath tree canopy
- **Leaf-Clearing Positions**: Moves to angles with fewer obstructing leaves
- **Accessibility Checking**: Validates that new positions are reachable
- **Timeout Protection**: Gives up after 10 seconds to prevent infinite loops

### üì¶ COLLECTING
**What it does**: Gathers dropped items from harvested trees
- **Active Search**: Scans 8-block radius for item entities
- **Pathfinding**: Actually moves toward items (not just proximity detection)
- **Priority System**: Goes for closest items first
- **Realistic Collection**: Respects Minecraft's pickup range (2 blocks)

### üèÉ MOVING_TO_ITEM
**What it does**: Pursues specific dropped items
- **Direct Navigation**: Moves straight toward target item
- **Distance Checking**: Gives up if item is too far or despawned
- **Collection Transition**: Switches to collecting when close enough

## üß† Decision Making Logic

### Tree Selection
1. **Proximity**: Closer trees get priority
2. **Accessibility**: Checks if tree base is reachable
3. **Type Recognition**: Identifies 1x1 vs 2x2 tree structures
4. **Ground Level**: Prefers trees at or near ground level

### Leaf Clearing Strategy
```
Player Position ‚Üí Raycast ‚Üí Tree Target
      ‚Üì
  Find First Leaf Block in Path
      ‚Üì
  Focus Mining on That Leaf
      ‚Üì
  Check if More Leaves Block Path
      ‚Üì
  Repeat Until Clear Line of Sight
```

### Positioning Logic
1. **Line-of-Sight Check**: Can I see the target block?
2. **Leaf Interference**: Are leaves blocking my view?
3. **Angle Optimization**: Is there a better position?
4. **Under-Tree Check**: Can I get underneath for upward mining?

### Problem Solving Hierarchy
1. **Try Current Position**: Attempt mining from current spot
2. **Clear Leaves**: Remove obstructing leaves if present
3. **Reposition Nearby**: Move to better angle (same level)
4. **Go Underneath**: Move below tree for upward mining
5. **Find Alternative Block**: Switch to different accessible log
6. **Give Up Tree**: Move to different tree entirely

## üéÆ Player-Like Behaviors

### Realistic Movement
- **Acceleration/Deceleration**: Smooth speed changes
- **Turn Speed Limiting**: No instant 180¬∞ rotations
- **Jump Intelligence**: Only jumps when necessary
- **Momentum Physics**: Feels natural, not robotic

### Mining Authenticity
- **Hold-to-Mine**: Simulates holding down mouse button
- **Progress Tracking**: Respects Minecraft's mining mechanics
- **Tool Requirements**: Works with player's equipped tools
- **Break Validation**: Proper block breaking with particles

### Error Recovery
- **Stuck Detection**: Recognizes when making no progress
- **Alternative Seeking**: Finds different approaches
- **Timeout Handling**: Prevents infinite loops
- **State Resetting**: Returns to known good states

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Scanning
- **Cooldown Systems**: Prevents excessive calculations
- **Range Limiting**: Only searches reasonable distances
- **State Caching**: Remembers previous decisions
- **Early Termination**: Stops searching when good option found

### Memory Management
- **Concurrent Safe**: Thread-safe player state tracking
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes inactive player states
- **Minimal Allocation**: Reuses objects when possible
- **Garbage Collection Friendly**: Avoids unnecessary object creation

## üîß Configuration Constants

```java
SEARCH_RADIUS = 16          // How far to look for trees
COLLECTION_RADIUS = 8       // How far to look for items  
REACH_DISTANCE = 4.5        // Mining reach limit
CHOP_COOLDOWN = 20          // Ticks between mining attempts
MAX_COLLECTION_ATTEMPTS = 10 // Retry limit for item collection
LEAF_CLEAR_RADIUS = 3       // Range for leaf detection
```

## üéØ Future AI Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
- **Multi-Tree Planning**: Optimize harvesting order for multiple trees
- **Tool Durability Awareness**: Switch tools or find repair options
- **Biome Adaptation**: Adjust behavior for different environments
- **Player Preference Learning**: Adapt to user's harvesting style
- **Collaborative AI**: Multiple AI instances working together

### Advanced Features
- **Terrain Analysis**: Better understanding of landscape
- **Risk Assessment**: Avoid dangerous situations (lava, mobs)
- **Resource Management**: Optimize inventory usage
- **Time-of-Day Awareness**: Adjust behavior for day/night cycle
