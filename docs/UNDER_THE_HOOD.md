# ü™ì Under the Hood: How Chipper Chopper Works

*A friendly developer's guide to understanding our AI lumberjack* ü§ñüå≤

---

## üé≠ **The Cast of Characters**

Think of our mod like a movie with different actors playing specific roles:

### üé¨ **Main Characters**

**ü§ñ TreeChopperAI** - *The Brain*
> "I'm the mastermind! I decide what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. Think of me like the brain of a very focused robot whose only job is chopping trees."

**üëæ ChipperChopperClient** - *The Hands*  
> "I'm the one who actually presses the keys and clicks the mouse! The brain tells me what to do, and I make it happen on your computer."

**üì¢ ChipperChopperMod** - *The Director*
> "I set up the whole show! I make sure everyone knows their lines (commands) and that the performance starts when you load the game."

---

## üß† **ELI5: How Does This Actually Work?**

### **Imagine Your Minecraft Character as a Remote-Control Car** üöó

1. **You Press G** ‚Üí "Hey car, turn on autopilot!"
2. **The Brain Wakes Up** ‚Üí "Okay, what trees do I see around here?"
3. **The Hands Take Control** ‚Üí "I'll press W to move forward, and click to break blocks!"
4. **Magic Happens** ‚Üí Your character moves and chops like a real player!

It's like having a really smart friend playing Minecraft for you, but they can only see trees and wood! üå≥

---

## üèóÔ∏è **The Technical Magic Show**

### **Act 1: The Great Awakening** üåÖ

When you start Minecraft:

```java
// The Director (ChipperChopperMod) sets up the stage
public void onInitialize() {
    // "Ladies and gentlemen, we have commands!"
    registerCommands();
    
    // "And we'll check what's happening every game tick!"
    ServerTickEvents.END_SERVER_TICK.register(TreeChopperAI::tick);
}
```

**ELI5**: Think of this like setting up a puppet show. The Director puts up the stage, arranges the strings (commands), and makes sure the puppet (your character) can move when the puppeteer (AI) pulls the strings!

### **Act 2: Client-Server Telepathy** üß†üí´

Here's where it gets spicy! Our mod works on TWO computers at once:

#### **üñ•Ô∏è Client Side (Your Computer)**
```java
// Client says: "User pressed G!"
KeyBinding.onKeyPressed(() -> {
    // Send a secret message to the server
    sendCommand("/chipper toggle");
});
```

#### **üåê Server Side (Game World)**
```java
// Server receives the message and thinks
if (command.equals("toggle")) {
    if (AI_is_sleeping) {
        wake_up_the_AI();
        send_message_back("ü§ñ AI activated!");
    }
}
```

**ELI5**: It's like you whispering to your friend across the room, "Start the robot!" and they whisper back, "Robot is go!" But instead of whispering, they use magical computer messages! ‚ú®

---

## üéØ **The State Machine: AI's Daily Routine**

Our AI is like a very organized person who follows the same routine every day:

```
IDLE ‚Üí "Just woke up, looking around..."
  ‚Üì
MOVING_TO_TREE ‚Üí "Spotted a tree! Walking there..."
  ‚Üì  
CHOPPING ‚Üí "At the tree! CHOP CHOP CHOP!"
  ‚Üì
COLLECTING ‚Üí "Tree is down! Grabbing the loot!"
  ‚Üì
IDLE ‚Üí "All done! Looking for the next tree..."
```

### **ü§ñ AI's Internal Monologue**

**IDLE**: *"Hmm, let me look around... OH! There's a tree at coordinates [x, y, z]!"*

**MOVING_TO_TREE**: *"Walking, walking, walking... are we there yet? ...are we there yet?"*

**CHOPPING**: *"CHOP! ...wait for cooldown... CHOP! ...wait for cooldown... Where's the next log block?"*

**COLLECTING**: *"Ooh, shiny wood! Must... collect... everything!"*

---

## üéÆ **Client-Side Magic: The Hands That Press Keys**

Here's where we get REALLY clever! Instead of cheating and teleporting your character, we actually simulate pressing keys:

```java
// This is like having a robot finger press your keyboard!
private static void driveKeys(MinecraftClient mc, Vec3d target) {
    GameOptions opts = mc.options;
    
    // Calculate which direction to go
    if (needToGoForward) {
        opts.forwardKey.setPressed(true);  // Press W
    }
    if (needToJump) {
        opts.jumpKey.setPressed(true);     // Press SPACE  
    }
    
    // Look at the target
    mc.player.setYaw(targetYaw);   // Turn head left/right
    mc.player.setPitch(targetPitch); // Look up/down
}
```

**ELI5**: Imagine you have a tiny robot sitting at your keyboard. When the AI brain says "go forward," the robot physically presses the W key for you! This is why servers can't tell you're using a bot - because you're not cheating, you're just pressing keys really precisely! ü§ñ‚å®Ô∏è

---

## ‚õèÔ∏è **Mining System: The Art of Clicking**

Breaking blocks is like teaching someone to use a hammer:

```java
// Step 1: Look at the block (like aiming)
faceBlock(mc, blockPos);

// Step 2: Start hitting it (left click)
interactionManager.attackBlock(blockPos, side);

// Step 3: Keep hitting until it breaks
interactionManager.updateBlockBreakingProgress(blockPos, side);
```

**ELI5**: It's like teaching a kid to use a hammer:
1. "Look at the nail" (face the block)
2. "Hit it once" (start mining)  
3. "Keep hitting until it's done" (continue mining)
4. "Great job! Now find the next nail!" (move to next block)

---

## üå≤ **Tree Detection: AI's Tree-Vision**

Our AI has special "tree vision" that works like this:

```java
// Scan in a 16-block radius (like binoculars!)
for (int x = -16; x <= 16; x += 2) {  // Skip every other block (efficiency!)
    for (int z = -16; z <= 16; z += 2) {
        for (int y = -5; y <= 10; y++) {
            BlockPos pos = playerPos.add(x, y, z);
            
            if (isLogBlock(world.getBlockState(pos))) {
                if (isTreeBase(world, pos)) {  // Make sure it's a real tree!
                    // Found one! Calculate distance
                    double distance = calculateDistance(playerPos, pos);
                    if (distance < nearestDistance) {
                        nearestTree = pos;  // This is our new target!
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**ELI5**: Imagine the AI puts on special glasses that can only see trees! It looks around in a big circle (16 blocks in every direction) and says, "Tree here! Tree there! But which one is closest to me?" Then it picks the closest one like choosing the closest cookie from a plate! üç™

---

## üîÑ **The Tick System: Minecraft's Heartbeat**

Minecraft runs at 20 TPS (Ticks Per Second), which means our AI gets to "think" 20 times every second:

```java
// This happens 20 times per second!
public static void tick(MinecraftServer server) {
    for (ServerPlayerEntity player : getPlayersWithActiveAI()) {
        AIState state = getPlayerState(player);
        
        // What should I do this tick?
        switch (state.currentTask) {
            case IDLE -> lookForTrees(player, state);
            case MOVING_TO_TREE -> keepWalkingToTree(player, state);
            case CHOPPING -> chopTheCurrentBlock(player, state);
            case COLLECTING -> grabNearbyItems(player, state);
        }
        
        // Update rotation smoothly
        updateRotation(player, state);
    }
}
```

**ELI5**: Imagine Minecraft is like a flip-book animation. Every page (tick) shows your character in a slightly different position. Our AI gets to "draw" what your character should do on each page, 20 times per second! That's why the movement looks smooth! üìñ‚ú®

---

## üéØ **Line-of-Sight: Can I See It?**

Before mining any block, we check if there's a clear path:

```java
// Imagine shooting a laser from your eyes to the block
private static boolean hasLineOfSight(MinecraftClient mc, BlockPos targetBlock) {
    Vec3d playerEyes = mc.player.getEyePos();  // Where are my eyes?
    Vec3d blockCenter = Vec3d.ofCenter(targetBlock);  // Where is the block?
    
    // Shoot an invisible ray and see what it hits first
    return mc.player.getWorld().raycast(new RaycastContext(
        playerEyes,      // Start from eyes
        blockCenter,     // Go to block
        COLLIDER,        // Stop at solid things
        NONE,            // Ignore water
        mc.player        // Don't hit myself!
    )).getBlockPos().equals(targetBlock);  // Did we hit our target?
}
```

**ELI5**: It's like playing laser tag! The AI shoots an invisible laser from your character's eyes to the tree block. If the laser hits a leaf or another block first, the AI says "Nope, can't see it!" and looks for a different block to chop! üî¶

---

## üßÆ **2x2 Tree Logic: Big Tree, Big Brain**

Dark Oak and Jungle trees are special - they're made of 4 log blocks in a square. Our AI is smart enough to handle this:

```java
// Look for logs in all directions, not just up!
BlockPos[] adjacentOffsets = {
    new BlockPos(1, 0, 0),   // East
    new BlockPos(-1, 0, 0),  // West  
    new BlockPos(0, 0, 1),   // South
    new BlockPos(0, 0, -1),  // North
    new BlockPos(1, 0, 1),   // Southeast
    new BlockPos(-1, 0, -1), // Northwest
    new BlockPos(1, 0, -1),  // Northeast
    new BlockPos(-1, 0, 1)   // Southwest
};

// Check same level first, then go up
for (BlockPos offset : adjacentOffsets) {
    BlockPos checkPos = currentPos.add(offset);
    if (isLogBlock(world.getBlockState(checkPos))) {
        return checkPos;  // Found the next piece!
    }
}
```

**ELI5**: Imagine you're eating a chocolate bar that's made of 4 squares stuck together. Instead of just eating straight up, you need to eat all the pieces on the same level first, then move up to the next row. That's exactly what our AI does with big trees! üç´

---

## üö¶ **Anti-Spam System: Chill Out, AI**

We added a cooldown system so the AI doesn't spam the console:

```java
private static long lastLineOfSightCheck = 0;
private static final long LINE_OF_SIGHT_COOLDOWN = 1000; // 1 second

// Only complain once per second!
long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
if (currentTime - lastLineOfSightCheck > LINE_OF_SIGHT_COOLDOWN) {
    System.out.println("No line of sight - waiting for server!");
    lastLineOfSightCheck = currentTime;
}
```

**ELI5**: You know how little kids sometimes repeat the same question over and over? "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?" We taught our AI to only ask once per second instead of 20 times per second! Much more polite! ü§ê

---

## üîß **The Hooks: How We Plug Into Minecraft**

### **Fabric Mod Loader Magic**

Our `fabric.mod.json` file is like a business card that tells Minecraft who we are:

```json
{
    "entrypoints": {
        "main": ["com.example.chipperChopper.ChipperChopperMod"],      // Server-side
        "client": ["com.example.chipperChopper.ChipperChopperClient"]  // Client-side
    }
}
```

**ELI5**: This is like telling Minecraft, "Hey, when you start up, please run these two programs. One for the server computer, and one for the player's computer!"

### **Event Hooks: Listening to Minecraft's Gossip**

```java
// Listen for when the server finishes thinking each tick
ServerTickEvents.END_SERVER_TICK.register(TreeChopperAI::tick);

// Listen for when the client finishes thinking each tick  
ClientTickEvents.END_CLIENT_TICK.register(ChipperChopperClient::onClientTick);

// Listen for key presses
KeyBindingHelper.registerKeyBinding(toggleAIKeyBinding);
```

**ELI5**: Imagine Minecraft is constantly whispering updates like "Tick finished! Key pressed! Player moved!" Our mod is like having really good hearing - we listen for these whispers and react when we hear the ones we care about! üëÇ

---

## üìä **Performance Wizardry**

### **Why We Skip Blocks**
```java
for (int x = -16; x <= 16; x += 2) {  // Notice the += 2!
```
Instead of checking every single block in a 16x16 area (1,024 blocks), we only check every other block (256 blocks). That's 75% less work!

**ELI5**: Imagine you're looking for your lost toy in a big field. Instead of checking every single blade of grass, you take big steps and only look every few feet. You'll still find your toy, but much faster! üß∏

### **Concurrent Collections: Thread Safety**
```java
private static final Map<UUID, AIState> playerStates = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```

**ELI5**: This is like having a special notebook that multiple people can write in at the same time without their handwriting getting all mixed up! Important when lots of players are using the AI! üìù

---

## üé≠ **Refactoring Game Plan**

### **üéØ Phase 1: Clean Up the Mess**

**Current Issues:**
- Some methods are doing too many things at once
- Magic numbers scattered everywhere  
- Client and server code is getting tangled

**The Plan:**
1. **Extract Constants** - Move all those magic numbers to a config class
2. **Split Responsibilities** - Break up big methods into smaller, focused ones
3. **Clean Interfaces** - Make client-server communication crystal clear

### **üîß Phase 2: Architecture Improvements**

**Target Structure:**
```
ChipperChopper/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AIStateMachine.java      // Just the state logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TreeDetector.java        // Just tree finding
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PathFinder.java          // Just movement
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InputSimulator.java      // Just key pressing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MiningController.java    // Just block breaking
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ClientEventHandler.java  // Just client events
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AITickHandler.java       // Just server ticking
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ServerEventHandler.java  // Just server events
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ChipperConfig.java       // All the settings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ util/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MathUtils.java           // Vector calculations
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BlockUtils.java          // Block type checking
```

### **üöÄ Phase 3: Feature Expansion**

**Cool Ideas for Later:**
- **Multi-Tree Planning**: "I see 5 trees, which order should I chop them?"
- **Tool Management**: "Oh no, my axe broke! Let me get a new one!"
- **Smart Inventory**: "My inventory is full, let me drop some cobblestone!"
- **Replanting**: "Better plant some saplings so the forest grows back!"

### **üéÆ Phase 4: User Experience Polish**

- **Config GUI**: In-game settings panel
- **Visual Indicators**: Show which tree the AI is targeting
- **Sound Effects**: Satisfying chop sounds
- **Statistics**: "You've chopped 1,247 trees this session!"

---

## üéì **Key Learnings for Future Developers**

### **üí° What We Did Right**
1. **Realistic Input Simulation** - Servers can't detect it because it's real key presses!
2. **State Machine Design** - Easy to debug and extend
3. **Client-Server Separation** - Clean architecture that scales
4. **Line-of-Sight Validation** - No cheaty mining through leaves

### **ü§î What We'd Do Differently**
1. **Start with Config System** - Would've saved lots of hardcoded magic numbers
2. **More Modular Design** - Some classes got too big too fast  
3. **Better Error Handling** - More graceful failures when weird stuff happens
4. **Unit Tests** - Would've caught bugs earlier

### **üèÜ Pro Tips for Minecraft Modding**
1. **Always Use Real Player Actions** - Fake teleportation gets you banned!
2. **Thread Safety is Critical** - Minecraft is multithreaded, plan accordingly
3. **Performance Matters** - That tick method runs 20 times per second!
4. **Listen to Your Users** - They'll find edge cases you never imagined

---

## üéâ **Conclusion: The Magic Behind the Magic**

At its heart, Chipper Chopper is like having a really smart, really patient friend who's willing to do the boring tree-chopping work for you. We've built a system that:

- **Thinks** like a human (state machine)
- **Acts** like a human (key presses and mouse clicks)  
- **Sees** like a human (line-of-sight checking)
- **Learns** like a human (adapts when stuck)

But it does all of this 20 times per second with perfect precision! 

The real magic isn't in any single piece of code - it's in how all these pieces work together to create the illusion of intelligence. Your character moves naturally, makes smart decisions, and never gets tired of chopping trees! 

**And the best part?** It's all done with the power of really good organization, clever algorithms, and a deep understanding of how Minecraft actually works under the hood! üé©‚ú®

---

## üöÅ **Advanced Repositioning System: When AI Gets Stuck**

One of the biggest improvements based on the Gemini research is our **repositioning system**. When the AI can't reach a block, it doesn't just give up - it gets smart about finding a better position!

### **The Problem: Getting Stuck** ü§Ø
```
AI: "I want to chop that log block!"
Tree: "You can't see me through these leaves!"
AI: "I'll keep trying... trying... trying..."
*Gets stuck in infinite loop*
```

### **The Solution: Smart Repositioning** üß†‚ú®

When the AI gets stuck for more than 3 seconds, it triggers the repositioning system:

```java
// Step 1: Try to find a different log block first
BlockPos nextLog = findNextLogBlock(world, state.targetTree);

// Step 2: If no different block, find a better position
if (nextLog == null && state.repositionAttempts < 3) {
    BlockPos betterPos = findBetterPosition(world, player.getBlockPos(), state.targetTree);
    if (betterPos != null) {
        state.currentTask = AIState.Task.REPOSITIONING;
        state.repositionTarget = betterPos;
    }
}
```

**ELI5**: Imagine you're trying to reach a cookie jar, but there's a chair in the way. Instead of just reaching and reaching, you walk around the chair to get a better angle. That's exactly what our AI does! üç™

### **How Position Finding Works** üéØ

```java
private static BlockPos findBetterPosition(World world, BlockPos playerPos, BlockPos targetBlock) {
    // Try walking towards the target in steps
    for (int distance = 1; distance <= 4; distance++) {
        // Calculate a position closer to the target
        Vec3d newPos = Vec3d.ofCenter(playerPos).add(direction.multiply(distance));
        
        // Check if this position is safe and has line-of-sight
        if (isValidPosition(world, testPos) && hasServerLineOfSight(world, testPos, targetBlock)) {
            return testPos; // Found a good spot!
        }
    }
    
    // Try positions in a circle around the target
    for (int radius = 2; radius <= 4; radius++) {
        for (int angle = 0; angle < 360; angle += 45) {
            // Calculate position at this angle and distance
            BlockPos testPos = targetBlock.add(offsetX, 0, offsetZ);
            // Test if it's safe and has good line-of-sight
        }
    }
}
```

**ELI5**: The AI is like a photographer trying to get the perfect shot. First it tries walking closer to the subject. If that doesn't work, it walks in a circle around the subject trying different angles until it finds the perfect spot! üì∏

---

## ‚ö° **Enhanced Movement System: Physics-Based Intelligence**

Gone are the days of robotic, instant movement! Our new system simulates real physics and momentum.

### **Momentum-Based Movement** üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Instead of instantly pressing/releasing keys, we simulate realistic acceleration:

```java
// AI has momentum like a real player!
private static float currentVelocity = 0.0f;
private static float desiredVelocity = 0.0f;

// When AI wants to move
desiredVelocity = 1.0f; // "I want to go full speed!"

// Smooth acceleration (like pressing W gradually)
currentVelocity = lerp(currentVelocity, desiredVelocity, ACCELERATION);

// Apply friction (like letting go of W gradually)  
currentVelocity *= FRICTION;

// Only actually press the key if there's enough momentum
if (currentVelocity > 0.01f) {
    opts.forwardKey.setPressed(true);
}
```

**ELI5**: It's like the difference between a robot that instantly starts and stops vs. a real person who gradually speeds up and slows down. Our AI now moves like a human who needs a moment to get going and a moment to stop! üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ÜíüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Üíüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### **Smooth Camera Rotation** üìπ

No more instant head snapping! The AI now turns its head smoothly:

```java
// Calculate how far we need to turn
float yawDifference = targetYaw - currentYaw;

// Handle the wrap-around (going from 359¬∞ to 1¬∞)
while (yawDifference < -180.0f) yawDifference += 360.0f;
while (yawDifference >= 180.0f) yawDifference -= 360.0f;

// Turn smoothly, not instantly
float yawStep = Math.min(Math.abs(yawDifference), TURN_SPEED);
mc.player.setYaw(currentYaw + yawStep);
```

**ELI5**: Instead of the AI's head spinning like an owl, it now turns like a normal person - smoothly looking from one side to the other! ü¶â‚Üíüòä

### **Intelligent Jumping System** ü¶ò

The new jumping logic is much smarter about when and why to jump:

```java
private static boolean shouldJump(MinecraftClient mc, Vec3d dir) {
    // Look ahead multiple distances
    for (double distance = 0.5; distance <= 2.0; distance += 0.5) {
        // Check for obstacles at different heights
        for (int height = 0; height <= 1; height++) {
            if (foundObstacle) {
                // Is there space above it? Can we jump on it?
                if (hasSpaceAbove && obstacleHeight <= 2.0) {
                    return true; // Yes, jump!
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Also check for gaps/cliffs to jump across
    if (gapAhead && hasRunningRoom) {
        return true; // Jump the gap!
    }
}
```

**ELI5**: 
- **Old AI**: "There's a block! JUMP!" *jumps at every pebble*
- **New AI**: "Let me see... that's a 1-block-high obstacle with space above it, and I have room to land. Perfect jumping opportunity!" *jumps only when it makes sense*

The new AI can:
- ‚úÖ Jump over small obstacles (1-2 blocks high)
- ‚úÖ Jump across small gaps 
- ‚úÖ Avoid jumping at walls (no space above)
- ‚úÖ Avoid jumping off cliffs (no landing spot)

---

## üéØ **State Machine Evolution: New REPOSITIONING State**

Our state machine got a new friend! 

```
IDLE ‚Üí MOVING_TO_TREE ‚Üí CHOPPING ‚Üí COLLECTING
                           ‚Üì
                      REPOSITIONING ‚Üê‚Üí (finds better position)
                           ‚Üì
                      CHOPPING (resumes from better spot)
```

### **REPOSITIONING State Logic** üîÑ

```java
case REPOSITIONING:
    double distance = player.getPos().distanceTo(Vec3d.ofCenter(state.repositionTarget));
    
    if (distance <= 1.5) {
        // Made it to the better position!
        state.currentTask = AIState.Task.CHOPPING;
        state.repositionTarget = null;
        LOGGER.info("Repositioning complete, resuming chopping");
    } else if (distance > 20) {
        // Something went wrong, too far away
        state.currentTask = AIState.Task.IDLE;
        LOGGER.info("Repositioning failed, returning to idle");
    } else {
        // Still walking to the better position
        state.isMoving = true;
    }
```

**ELI5**: It's like when you're trying to thread a needle. If you can't see well from where you're sitting, you don't give up - you move to a spot with better lighting! The AI does the same thing with tree blocks! ü™°üí°

## üéØ **Critical Fixes in v2.1: Smoother Operation**

### **Problem: Snappy/Jumpy Rotation** üòµ‚Äçüí´

**Old System Issues:**
- Server and client both trying to control rotation simultaneously
- High rotation speeds (15¬∞/tick client, 8¬∞/tick server) 
- Constant rotation updates every tick

**New Solution:** üéÆ
```java
// Server-side: Reduced speed and less frequent updates
private static final double ROTATION_SPEED = 3.0; // Reduced from 8.0
if (state.ticksSinceLastAction % 5 == 0) { // Only every 5 ticks
    updateRotation(player, state);
}

// Client-side: Only rotate when far from target, let server handle mining
if (horizDistance > 4.0) { // Only rotate when moving
    if (Math.abs(yawDifference) > 10.0f) { // Only if significant difference
        float yawStep = Math.min(Math.abs(yawDifference), TURN_SPEED);
        mc.player.setYaw(currentYaw + yawStep);
    }
}
// Don't set pitch here, let server handle it during mining
```

**ELI5**: Imagine two people trying to steer a car at the same time - chaos! Now we have clear roles: the client steers when walking long distances, the server steers when doing precise mining work. Much smoother! üöó

### **Problem: Repositioning Never Triggered** üîÑ

**Old Logic Flaw:**
```java
// Old broken logic
if (stuck for 3 seconds) {
    try_different_log_block(); // This always found something!
    if (no_different_block) {  // This never happened!
        try_repositioning();   // So this never ran!
    }
}
```

**New Priority System:** üß†
```java
// New smart logic - repositioning comes FIRST
if (stuck for 2 seconds) { // Faster trigger
    if (repositionAttempts < 3) {
        try_repositioning(); // TRY THIS FIRST!
        if (repositioning_failed) {
            try_different_log_block(); // Fallback option
        }
    }
}

// PLUS: Client can trigger repositioning directly
if (consecutiveLineOfSightFailures >= 10) {
    force_immediate_repositioning(); // Don't wait for server timeout!
}
```

**ELI5**: 
- **Old AI**: "Can't reach cookie jar... let me try a different cookie first... oh wait, there's always a different cookie!" *never moves*
- **New AI**: "Can't reach cookie jar... let me try moving to a better spot FIRST... if that doesn't work, THEN I'll try different cookies!" *actually moves when stuck*

### **Enhanced Client-Server Communication** üì°

**New Communication Methods:**
```java
// Client reports progress to reset server timeout
TreeChopperAI.notifyMiningProgress(mc.player);

// Client reports line-of-sight failures to trigger repositioning
TreeChopperAI.notifyLineOfSightFailure(mc.player);
```

**Smart Failure Detection:**
```java
public static void notifyLineOfSightFailure(PlayerEntity player) {
    state.consecutiveLineOfSightFailures++;
    
    // After 10 consecutive failures, force repositioning
    if (state.consecutiveLineOfSightFailures >= 10 && state.repositionAttempts < 3) {
        BlockPos betterPos = findBetterPosition(world, player.getBlockPos(), state.targetTree);
        if (betterPos != null) {
            state.currentTask = AIState.Task.REPOSITIONING;
        }
    }
}
```

**ELI5**: Now the client can tap the server on the shoulder and say "Hey, I've been blocked 10 times in a row, maybe we should move?" instead of just silently suffering! üìû
