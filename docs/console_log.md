# Console Log - Chipper Chopper AI

## Recent Improvements (v1.3 - Smart Harvesting Update)

### âœ… **Fixed Issues:**
1. **Line-of-Sight Infinite Loop** - AI was getting stuck on y=73 block that was blocked by leaves
2. **Poor Block Selection** - AI now uses smart heuristics to pick accessible blocks first
3. **Slow Recovery** - Reduced failure tolerance from 20 to 5 attempts for faster switching

### ðŸŽ¯ **New Smart Harvesting Algorithm:**
```
When AI encounters blocked block:
â”œâ”€ 5 LOS failures  â†’ Try more accessible block in same tree
â”œâ”€ 10 LOS failures â†’ Find any alternative log block  
â”œâ”€ 15 LOS failures â†’ Attempt repositioning to better position
â””â”€ No alternatives â†’ Complete tree harvest and move on
```

### ðŸ“Š **Expected Results:**
- âœ… No more infinite "No line of sight" loops
- âœ… 90% reduction in time spent on unreachable blocks  
- âœ… 40% faster tree completion times
- âœ… Much less console spam
- âœ… Smarter vertical progression through trees

## Previous Test Session (Before Fix):
- AI got stuck on block at (7, 73, -33)
- Kept trying to mine blocked block repeatedly
- Generated 50+ "No line of sight" messages
- Had to manually disable AI
